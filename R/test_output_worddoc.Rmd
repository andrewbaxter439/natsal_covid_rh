246 respondents (17.4% of total) answered ‘Not applicable’ as they were already pregnant, planning to get pregnant of unable to get pregnant. These responses are excluded from the table. Participants who used only emergency contraceptives are classed as ‘no method used’. P-values were calculated from F values generated from Pearson X2 statistics using the second order correction Rao and Scott (1984).

```

631 participants reported only or usually using a ‘more effective’ method of contraception in the year before the first lockdown. Users of emergency contraception only were classed as ‘stopped using contraceptives’. P-values were calculated from F values generated from Pearson X2 statistics using the second order correction Rao and Scott (1984).


# Table 4 — Percentage of sexually active participants aged 18-44 years participants who had a pregnancy in the last year and differences in ‘plannedness’ of pregnancies


```{r, warning=FALSE}

  tab_header(title = "A pregnancy in the last year and proportion of pregnancies which were unplanned (% (95%CI)); mean and adjusted differences in LMUP score (difference (CI))") %>% 
  tab_style(style = cell_text(align = "left", size = 20), locations = cells_title())

```

The London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy (LMUP) score scores each pregnancy on a range of 0-12 to represent the relative plannedness of the pregnancy. Differences for LMUP score across all categories other than age are adjusted for age using a linear regression model.

246 respondents (17.4% of total) answered ‘Not applicable’ to questions of usual contraception used as they were already pregnant, planning to get pregnant of unable to get pregnant. 142 respondents (9.5%) answered ‘no method used’ in the year before lockdown.
